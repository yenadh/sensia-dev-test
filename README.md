## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a **full-stack web application** built using **React** (frontend) and **Django REST Framework** (backend). It provides a centralized dashboard for a **Super Admin** to manage users, assign fine-grained page-level permissions, and monitor user activity. The system includes role-based access control and a comment system with detailed modification history tracking.
